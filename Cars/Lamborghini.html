<h2>History of Lamborghini</h2>
<p>Lamborghini was founded in 1963 by Italian entrepreneur Ferruccio Lamborghini in Sant’Agata Bolognese, Italy. Originally a successful tractor manufacturer, Ferruccio decided to create high-performance sports cars after a dispute with Enzo Ferrari about Ferrari’s car reliability. Lamborghini’s early models, like the 350 GT and the iconic Miura, set a new standard for design and performance, establishing Lamborghini as a top luxury brand. Financial struggles in the 1970s led to ownership changes, and in 1998, Volkswagen Group’s Audi division acquired the company, helping revitalize it. Lamborghini has since introduced modern classics like the Aventador and Huracán, known for their powerful engines and distinctive, aggressive designs. Today, Lamborghini remains a premier brand in the high-performance sports car industry.</p>
