<h2>History of Bugatti</h2>
<p>Bugatti was founded in 1909 by Italian-born French automotive designer Ettore Bugatti in Molsheim, Alsace (then part of Germany, now France). Known for its high-performance and luxurious cars, Bugatti gained fame in the 1920s and 1930s with models like the Type 35, a highly successful race car, and the opulent Type 41 Royale. However, after World War II, the company struggled and ceased production in the 1950s. In 1987, Italian entrepreneur Romano Artioli revived the brand, launching the EB110 supercar in the early 1990s. Later acquired by Volkswagen Group in 1998, Bugatti launched the Veyron in 2005, setting new standards in speed and luxury. Bugatti continues to produce ultra-exclusive hypercars like the Chiron, blending engineering excellence with timeless design.</p>
