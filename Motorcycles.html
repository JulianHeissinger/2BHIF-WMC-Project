    <h1>Motorcycles</h1>

    <span class="cool">Sometimes the most dangerous "hobby".</span>
    <span class="cool">Sometimes a safe way to travel.</span>
    <span class="cool">Sometimes a way of connecting with people.</span>
    <span class="cool">Always a way of having <rem>Fun.</rem></span>

    <h2 class="header">The <rem>History:</rem></h2>

    <p>The first ever Motorcycle was invented in 1885. The Daimler-Reitwagen. Production ramped up during the first world war. Messengers used them to communicate with the frontline.</p>
    <p>Harley-Davidson was the biggest manufacturer after the war, selling to 67 countries.</p>
    <p>Nowadays, not much has changed. But there has been a shift away from two-stroke engines to four-stroke engines.</p>

    <h2 class="header">The big <rem>Brands.</rem></h2>

    <h2 class="header" id="underDucati">I have only shown sport-bikes, but there are several types of Motorcycles:</h2>

    <ul style="list-style: none">
        <li>
            <p align="center"><rem>Naked Bikes:</rem></p>
            <span class="cool">They have almost no fairings and a comfortable seating position. They are also some of the most affordable Bikes.</span>
            <img class="TypeTemplate" src="Img/NakedBikeTemplate.jpg" alt="Naked Bike">
            <span class="image-subtitle">2024 Ducati Monster SP</span>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p align="center"><rem>Choppers:</rem></p>
        <span class="cool">Made to be very comfortable over long periods of time. Prices vary a lot. They are often seen as a status symbol. They aren't made to be fast, but often have lots of torque.</span>
        <img class="TypeTemplate" src="Img/ChopperTemplate.jpg" alt="Chopper">
        <span class="image-subtitle">2024 Triumph Bobber</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p align="center"><rem>Supermotos:</rem></p>
            <span class="cool">Light, but fast Motorcycles. They are often more expensive than most people think. Many also available as a two-stroke. They have lots of acceleration, but a relatively low top speed, which is fine because of the lack of wind protection.</span>
            <img class="TypeTemplate" src="Img/SupermotoTemplate.jpg" alt="Supermoto">
            <span class="image-subtitle">2024 Husqvarna 701</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p align="center"><rem>Sport Bikes:</rem></p>
            <span class="cool">Made for racing. Very expensive, aerodynamic Motorcycles. They have a very aggressive seating position, and lots of power (most of the time).</span>
            <img class="TypeTemplate" src="Img/SupersportTemplate.jpg" alt="Sport Bike">
            <span class="image-subtitle">2024 Ducati Supersport 950</span>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="header">There´s a lot more than those, but they are mostly mixtures of these kinds of Motorcycles.</h2>

    <h1>What is the motorcycle market like now?</h1>

    <span class="cool">Over the last 20 years there has been a shift towards extremely fast <rem>(300+ km/h)</rem> models.</span>
    <span class="cool">Most people don't bother with small 250cc bikes anymore.</span>
    <span class="cool">Electronic rider aids (like <abbr title="Anti-lock Brake System">ABS</abbr>, <abbr title="Traction Control System">TCS</abbr>, <abbr title="Wheelie Control System">WCS</abbr>,...) have saved a lot of riders, but the death rate is higher than ever.</span>
    <span class="cool">Motorcycles have also been getting as expensive as most new Cars.</span>

    <h2 align="center">So is it even worth getting a new Bike?</h2>
