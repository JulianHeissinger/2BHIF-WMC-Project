<h2>History of Ferrari</h2>
<p>Ferrari was founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari in Maranello, Italy, originally as Auto Avio Costruzioni, producing its first car in 1940. However, Ferrariâ€™s iconic journey began with the 125 S in 1947, the first car to bear the Ferrari name. Renowned for its racing prowess, Ferrari quickly became a dominant force in Formula One, winning numerous championships from the 1950s onward. The brand's commitment to performance and exclusivity helped establish it as a symbol of luxury and speed, creating legendary models like the 250 GTO, Testarossa, and Enzo. In 2015, Ferrari became an independent entity after separating from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Today, Ferrari remains a global icon of high-performance sports cars and motorsport heritage.</p>
