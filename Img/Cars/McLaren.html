<h2>History of McLaren</h2>
<p>McLaren was founded in 1963 by New Zealand racing driver Bruce McLaren as Bruce McLaren Motor Racing. Initially focused on Formula One, McLaren quickly gained a reputation for innovation, becoming a major competitor in the racing world. After Bruce’s untimely death in 1970, the team continued under new leadership, achieving great success with drivers like Ayrton Senna and Niki Lauda. In 1992, McLaren launched its first road car, the McLaren F1, which set a record as the world’s fastest production car and became a legendary supercar. McLaren Automotive was officially established in 2010, producing models like the 720S and P1 hybrid hypercar. Today, McLaren is celebrated for its advanced engineering, combining Formula One expertise with cutting-edge automotive technology in its road cars.</p>
