    <h2 class="header">The <rem>History:</rem></h2>

    <p>The first ever Motorcycle was invented in 1885. The Daimler-Reitwagen. Production ramped up during the first world war. Messengers used them to communicate with the frontline.</p>
    <p>Harley-Davidson was the biggest manufacturer after the war, selling to 67 countries.</p>
    <p>Nowadays, not much has changed. But there has been a shift away from two-stroke engines to four-stroke engines.</p>

    <span class="cool">Over the last 20 years there has been a shift towards extremely fast <rem>(300+ km/h)</rem> models.</span>
    <span class="cool">Most people don't bother with small 250cc bikes anymore.</span>
    <span class="cool">Electronic rider aids (like <abbr title="Anti-lock Brake System">ABS</abbr>, <abbr title="Traction Control System">TCS</abbr>, <abbr title="Wheelie Control System">WCS</abbr>,...) have saved a lot of riders, but the death rate is higher than ever.</span>
    <span class="cool">Motorcycles have also been getting as expensive as most new Cars.</span>

    <h2 align="center">So is it even worth getting a new Bike?</h2>
