        <h1>History of the Automobile</h1>

                <p>The automobile was born in the late 19th century, with Karl Benz's creation of the first gasoline-powered car in 1885.</p>

                <p>Early models were <em>slow</em>, <em>expensive</em>, and not widely available, but <em>innovations</em> soon followed.</p>

                <p>Henry Ford <em>revolutionized</em> the industry with <em>mass production</em> in the early 20th century, making cars <em>affordable</em> to many.</p>

                <p>The introduction of electric starters, improved engines, and road infrastructure fueled the car's popularity.</p>

                <p>By the mid-20th century, cars became a symbol of freedom, convenience, and modern living.</p>
