<h2>History of BMW</h2>
<p>BMW (Bayerische Motoren Werke) was founded in 1916 in Munich, Germany, initially as a manufacturer of aircraft engines. After World War I, due to restrictions on aircraft production, BMW shifted to making motorcycles in 1923 and later cars in 1928. Its first major success came with the BMW 328, a lightweight sports car, in the 1930s. Post-World War II, BMW nearly collapsed but revived in the 1960s with the introduction of the New Class sedans. Over the decades, BMW became known for its luxury cars and sporty performance, producing iconic models like the 3 Series and expanding into electric vehicles with the i-series. Today, it is a global leader in the premium automotive sector.</p>
